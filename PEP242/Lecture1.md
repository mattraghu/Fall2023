## Ultraviolet Catastrophe

According to classical rules of physics, **as frequency increases, the energy of the black body should increase**. However, the experiment shows that the energy of the black body is not infinite, but has a maximum value. This is called the **ultraviolet catastrophe**.

The blackbody equation for energy density is:

$$
u(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi\nu^2}{c^3}kT
$$

where $u$ is the energy density, $\nu$ is the frequency, $T$ is the temperature, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.

However, it was found that the energy density of the black body is not infinite, but has a maximum value.

## Michelson-Morley Experiment

It was assumed light needed a **medium** to travel - the **luminiferous aether**

- However, it was observed that light travels through vacuum
- Thus it was assumed that vacuums possessed an invisible medium - the aether
- The Michelson-Morley experiment was designed to detect the aether
