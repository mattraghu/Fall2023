# Economics - Lecture 1

## Economics

The study of how scare productive resources (land labor and capital) are allocated among alterneative uses and how the resulting commodities are distributed.

- **Land** - Natural Resources
- **Labor** - Human Activity
- **Capital** - Tools, Technologies, Factories, etc.

  - **Human Capital** - Knowledge, Skills, etc.
  - **Entrepreneurial Capital** - Ability to organize and manage resources. Risk own capital for profit.

  ## Pitfalls to Economic Models

  - Correlation does not imply causation
    - When super bowl winner is from the NFC, the stock market goes up
    - Is the super bowl winner causing the stock market to go up? No.
  - Post hoc ergo propter hoc
    - After this, therefore because of this
    - Unrealistic assumptions
    - When the rooster crows, the sun rises
    - Does the rooster cause the sun to rise? No.
  - Fallacy of composition
    - What is true for the individual is not necessarily true for the group
    - If you stand up at a football game, you can see better

## Economic Statements

1. **Positive Economic Statement** - A statement that can be tested and validated. It is a statement of fact.
2. **Normative Economic Statement** - A statement that cannot be tested or validated. It is an opinion.

## Occam's Razor

- Came up with by William of Occam, a 14th century philosopher.
- The simplest explanation is usually the correct one.A

- Kiss - Keep it simple stupid

## Economic Models

- PNFI - Private Non-Residential Fixed Investment

  - PNFI = 1683.1 - 36.6 \* Prime
  - Prime is the prime interest rate (%)
  - PNFI is the amount of money invested in the economy (billions of dollars)

  1. The slope coefficient is the change in PNFI for a one unit change in the prime
  2. The $R^2$ tells us how much of the variation in PNFI is explained by the prime
  3. If $|t| > 2$, then the coefficient is significant.
  4. The standard error of the estimate is the average distance between the actual and predicted values of the dependent variable.

- Production Possibilities Model
  - Intended to show the basic economic problem of scarcity
  - Desire for goods and services exceeds the ability to produce them
  - Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative
