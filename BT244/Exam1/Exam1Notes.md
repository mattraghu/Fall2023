# Microeconomics Exam 1 Notes

## Economics

Study of how scarce productive resources are allocated among alternative uses and how the resulting commodities are distributed.

- **Land** - Natural resources
- **Labor** - Human resources
- **Capital** - Tools, equipment, and factories. Human Capital is the knowledge and skills of workers. Entrepreneurship is the ability to organize and manage the other factors of production.

## Pitfalls to Economic Models

### Post hoc ergo propter hoc

After this, therefore because of this

In other words, correlation does not imply causation.

### Fallacy of composition

What is true for the individual is not necessarily true for the group.

## Economic Statements

### Positive Economic Statement

A statement that can be tested and validated. It is a statement of **fact**.

### Normative Economic Statement

A statement that cannot be tested or validated. It is an **opinion**.

## Ockham's Razor

The simplest explanation is usually the correct one.

Kiss - Keep it simple stupid

## Opportunity Cost

The value of the next best alternative.

### Example

Alexi and Tony own a food truck and output the following:

|       | Street Tacos | Cuban Sandwiches |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Alexi | 80           | 20               |
| Tony  | 100          | 30               |

#### What is the Opportunity Cost for a street taco?

Alexi:

$$\frac{20 \text{ Cuban Sandwiches}}{80 \text{ Street Tacos}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ Cuban Sandwiches per Street Taco}$$

Tony:

$$\frac{30 \text{ Cuban Sandwiches}}{100 \text{ Street Tacos}} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ Cuban Sandwiches per Street Taco}$$

Alexi has a lower opportunity cost for a street taco, and thus the **comparative advantage**.

## Private Non-Residential Fixed Investment

![PNFI](Media/PrimeVsI.png)

$$PNFI = 1683.1 - 36.6 \times Prime$$

- **PNFI** is the amount of money invested in the economy (billions of dollars)
- **Prime** is the prime interest rate (%) (the rate banks charge their best customers)
