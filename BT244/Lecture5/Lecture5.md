# Elasticity

Interpretation of the Elasticity Coeffcicient - The Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded for a 1% Change in Price

$$
\fbox{$\epsilon = \frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}$}
$$

- **Elastic** means:
  - when you lower price revenue goes up.
  - there are many substitutes.
  - the coefficient is greater than 1.
  - if price is high relative to income.
  - luxury goods.
- **Inelastic** means:
  - when you lower price revenue goes down.
  - there are few substitutes.
  - the coefficient is less than 1.
  - if price is low relative to income.
  - necessities.

## Example 1

Say $Q = 360 - 2P$. Find the elasticity of demand at $P = 50$.

$$
\epsilon = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \\
$$

$$
(50/260)*2=0.038 \\
$$

## Example 2

At a price of $100 the store sells 400 shirts. After dropping price to $80 sales increase to 700 shirts. Is demand elastic or inelastic?

$$
\$100 * 400 = \$40,000 \\
$$

vs

$$
\$80 * 700 = \$56,000 \\
$$

Thus, demand is elastic because **revenue increased** when **price decreased**.

## Elasticity of Demand for Income

$$
\epsilon = \frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta I} \\
$$

If $\epsilon > 0$ then the good is a **normal good**.

If $\epsilon < 0$ then the good is an **inferior good**.

## Cross Price Elasticity of Demand

$$
\epsilon_{xy} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_x}{\%\Delta P_y} \\
$$

If $\epsilon_{xy} > 0$ then the goods are **substitutes**.

If $\epsilon_{xy} < 0$ then the goods are **complements**.

## Elasticity of Supply

$$
\epsilon_s = \frac{\%\Delta Q_s}{\%\Delta P} \\
$$

If $\epsilon_s$ is **high** then the firm can easily change production.

If $\epsilon_s$ is **low** then the firm cannot easily change production.
